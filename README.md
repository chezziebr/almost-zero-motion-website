## Design System

The site uses the ZERO MOTION Design System with the following core principles:

### Colors

- **Black (#000000)** - Primary brand color, dominates
- **White (#FFFFFF)** - Contrast and breathing room
- **Performance Red (#FF4444)** - CTAs and emphasis (use sparingly)
- **Couch Gray (#E8E8E8)** - Soft backgrounds

### Typography

- **Headlines:** Bebas Neue, ALL CAPS, bold, tight leading
- **Body:** Inter, sentence case, regular weight, loose leading

### Brand Voice

Nike-style intensity applied to rest and recovery. Never break character. The comedy comes from playing it completely straight.
